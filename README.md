## Development Notes / Code Review

* When evaluating this code please keep in mind that I've spent the last 10 years building backend data engines, so where most developers are using things like Cassnadra / Redis & Postgres, I acually am the one who writes the back end code. So
  
  * Emphasis is on the modelling
  * My code process is to rapidly write out as much code as I can / then refactor
  * High emphasis on readability

I find writing 2 hour code tests frustrating / because even for a simple project it is very difficult to get it all "right" / and my process sometimes takes a lot longer at start as I try to invest in making the code flexible and testable as well as I believe in continuous refactoring and modelling in code and the debugger to see how things interact. Often it takes more than two horus.
